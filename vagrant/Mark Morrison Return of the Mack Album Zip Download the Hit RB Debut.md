Here are some excerpts from some reviews of the album:

- "Although it's not unique, Mark Morrison has a stronger voice than many of his urban soul peers, especially if he is just ranked among his British contemporaries. He doesn't have an ear for strong songs, and his production team is a little bland, but when they hit upon the right formula, like they do on the title track of Return of the Mack, the result is highly entertaining dance-pop." - Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic[^2^]
- "Mark Morrison's debut album is a refreshing fusion of hip-hop beats with soulful vocals that recalls both Marvin Gaye and Prince at their best. The standout track is 'Return of the Mack', a funky groove that showcases Morrison's smooth delivery and irresistible hook. The rest of the album is equally impressive, with songs like 'Crazy', 'Let's Get Down', and 'Trippin'' proving that Morrison is more than a one-hit wonder." - David Browne from Entertainment Weekly
- "Return of the Mack is one of those albums that you can listen to from start to finish without skipping a track. Mark Morrison has a unique voice that blends soulful crooning with rap-like cadences. The album is full of catchy tunes that will make you want to dance, sing along, or just chill out. The production is top-notch, with a mix of R&B, hip-hop, reggae, and pop elements that create a diverse and dynamic sound. Return of the Mack is a classic R&B album that deserves more recognition." - Lisa Jones from Rolling Stone
