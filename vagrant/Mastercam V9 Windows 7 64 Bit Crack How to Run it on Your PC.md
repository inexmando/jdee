## Step 4: Learn Some Mastercam V9 Tips and Tricks
 
Mastercam V9 is a versatile and powerful software that can help you create amazing CNC projects. However, it can also be challenging to master all the features and functions of Mastercam V9. That's why it is useful to learn some tips and tricks that can make your Mastercam V9 experience easier and more efficient. Here are some of the tips and tricks that you can find on the internet:
 
- Use the Edge Curves command to create a boundary from a complex 3D model. This can help you limit the toolpath to a specific area and avoid unnecessary machining [^1^].
- Use the Silhouette Boundary option to create a boundary from the outermost edges of a 3D model. This can help you create a roughing toolpath that covers the entire model without leaving any gaps [^1^].
- Use the Arc Filtering option to reduce the number of points in a toolpath and smooth out the motion. This can help you improve the surface finish and reduce machining time [^1^] [^2^].
- Use the Selection toolbar to quickly select entities by type, color, level or attribute. This can help you organize your geometry and modify your toolpaths easily [^2^].
- Use the Toolpath Display and Analyze options to view and edit your toolpaths in different ways. You can change the color, thickness, style and visibility of your toolpaths. You can also measure distances, angles, radii and other parameters of your toolpaths [^2^].
- Use the Lathe views to switch between front, side and isometric views of your lathe project. This can help you see your workpiece from different perspectives and check for errors or interferences [^2^].
- Use the 2D Peel option to create a 4-axis toolpath that peels away material from a cylindrical workpiece. This can help you create complex shapes and patterns on your lathe project [^2^].
- Use the Stock Model option to create a 3D model of your workpiece after each toolpath. This can help you visualize the machining process and check for collisions or gouges [^2^].
- Use the Viewsheet option to save and restore different views of your project. This can help you switch between different zoom levels, orientations, planes and display settings with one click [^2^].
- Use the Interface Customization option to change the appearance and layout of your Mastercam V9 interface. You can customize the menus, toolbars, icons, colors, fonts and other elements of your interface according to your preferences [^2^].
