Makhzan e Adab is a term that refers to two different but related things: a literary Urdu journal and a textbook of Urdu literature. Both of them are valuable sources of information and inspiration for anyone interested in Urdu language and culture.
 
## Makhzan e Adab: The Journal
 
Makhzan e Adab was a literary Urdu journal that was founded by Sir Sheikh Abdul Qadir in 1901. He was a prominent lawyer, judge, politician and scholar who was influenced by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan's movement of modernizing Muslim education and thought. Makhzan e Adab was one of the first and most influential Urdu journals of its time. It published original poetry, prose, criticism, history, biography, and translation by some of the most eminent writers of Urdu literature, such as Allama Iqbal, Altaf Hussain Hali, Muhammad Hussain Azad, Shibli Nomani, Akbar Allahabadi, and many others. Most of Iqbal's famous poems were first published in Makhzan e Adab, and Sheikh Abdul Qadir also wrote the preface to his first collection of Urdu poems, Bang-e-Dara. Makhzan e Adab also introduced many new genres and styles to Urdu literature, such as short stories, novels, essays, and literary criticism. The journal continued to be published until 1947, when it was discontinued due to the partition of India.
